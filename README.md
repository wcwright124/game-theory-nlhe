# hunl-tools

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create tools for analyzing heads up no limit hold 'em situations using game theory. We will develop classes for representing equity distributions and hand ranges. We also develop methods for producing .svg files to represent poker-stove style preflop ranges and methods for visualizing the interaction of two card ranges at any given street. We also implement Dudziak's fictitious play algorithm which can be used to analyze partial game trees represented as decision trees.
